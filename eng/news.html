							<h2 class="blog-post-title">ICEIRD 2017</h2>
							<p>Over the past 10 years, ICEIRD has become one of the leading entrepreneurship, innovation and regional development conferences in Europe, attracting academics and practitioners from around the world. ICEIRD over the past decade has focused on the importance of universities, industry and government, and how innovation-led growth can be promoted. As an innovative conference, which brings together academics, policymakers, practitioners, and businesses (companies), this year  the theme of ICEIRD is to advance research and to practice university-industry links. The conference is structured around three themes focused on research, co-production and commercialization through university-industry links.</p>
							<br>
							<p>ICEIRD aims at academics, university technology managers, entrepreneurs, policy- makers and businesses interested in the theory and practice of university-industry links as well as innovation, entrepreneurship, and regional development.</p>
							<br>
							<p>Academic papers, practitioner cases and provocative expositions in all areas of entrepreneurship, innovation and regional development are invited with particular emphasis on the <a href="http://iceird.eu/2017/conference-topics/" target="_blank">themes</a> of the conference</p>
							<br>
							<p>Thessaloniki is a popular destination, where you will certainly enjoy a pleasant and interesting stay among friendly people. The atmosphere is unique both during the day, in the historical, commercial and shopping centres, but especially during the evening, as you may enjoy a wide variety of bars, restaurants and theatres for entertainment. Thessaloniki is renowned for its unique location along the Thermaikos gulf, its sunset, its long history, its monuments and museums as well as its distinguished cuisine. We hope that all the delegates will have a successful conference, along with the chance to enjoy some of the traditional Greek hospitality for which our country is widely known.</p>

							<p>Thessaloniki Climathon: Inspiring behavioral change for a climate friendly city </p>
							<br>
							<p>The organisation of Climathon in Thessaloniki is an opportunity to open for the first time a broad discussion on climate change. The impacts of the phenomenon is gradually becoming evident and adds stress to already existing challenges for the city, from micro-climatic conditions and mobility through to strategic planning and decision making for urban development. Air quality degradation, the increasing frequency of weather extremes, droughts and extreme heat-waves and an apparent shift in seasons are among the manifestations of the phenomenon in the city. Thus it is understood that consequences are going to impair the daily functioning of the city on different levels: from quality of life to urban infrastructure and the use of public space through to mobility, energy and food production and consumption, and waste management. </p>
							<br>
							<p>Inspiring behavioural change to a wide audience of the society will be at the centre of the event’s agenda and, therefore, ideas will be developed around this concept. The development of sustainable and applicable solutions/tools in the city-scale is expected. Collaboration will be promoted during the workshop to create synergies that will help participants to mature innovative feasible solutions, while it will also provide the City with new good practices in the field of urban resilience strategy within the context of the '100 Resilient Cities' initiative in Thessaloniki. </p>
